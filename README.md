Steps to be followed for running the app:

1. Download the ZIP from the code section of this github repo

2. Create a new folder on the desktop

3. Extract the files from the zip into the new folder

4. Open the folder on VS Code

5. Open the terminal in VS code and run the command: npm start

6. The app will open in the available localhost

## Note: The video for the application is attached in the main branch of the repo, and is named as "Enview_video.mkv"

### Thank you so much for giving me this opportunity.
